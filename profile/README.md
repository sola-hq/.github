> We build in the open. We believe in light — not as metaphor, but as practice.  
> Systems that empower. Protocols that inspire. Code that lives in the light.

## 🌞 What is Sola?

**Sola** is a collective of independent developers, system architects, and tinkerers  
committed to building transparent, verifiable, and censorship-resistant technologies.

We design **tools**, **infra**, and **protocols** with sunlight in mind —  
favoring simplicity, clarity, and autonomy over complexity and obscurity.

---

## 🌱 Principles

- **Transparency over control**  
  We believe in verifiability, not trust.

- **Elegance over complexity**  
  Build only what needs to exist.

- **Community over gatekeeping**  
  Everyone contributes. No ivory towers.

- **Light over shadow**  
  We build where others obscure.

---

## 🧬 Stack We Love

- **Rust**, **TypeScript**, **WASM**
- **Solana**, **OpenTelemetry**, **gRPC**
- **ClickHouse**, **Loki**, **Postgres**
- **Self-hosted infra**, **Lightweight monitoring**, **Zero-trust**
